      Welcome, and bienvenue. I like long walks on the beach, often with laptop and some code! Sometimes I just like to cascade my css for fun and prizes.

    <ul>
      <li>I play ukelele</li>
      <li>I do not have a fish named Jim</li>
      <li>Even now, the rebek base is under attack....the got a shipment</li>
      <li>Repeating any word too many times makes it sound odd</li>
      <li>Hey, is that a tentacle</li>
    </ul>
